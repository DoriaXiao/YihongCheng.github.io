Hi there, and thanks for visiting my site!  

I’m Xingyao (Doria) Xiao, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford. My research brings together **psychometrics, Bayesian modeling, and AI** to understand learning and improve assessment.  

I built this space to share what I’m working on, from new papers and projects to talks and teaching. I’ll also post occasional reflections on methods and the joys (and headaches!) of modeling complex data.  

Feel free to explore the pages above, and if anything catches your interest, I’d love to connect.
