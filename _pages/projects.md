- **BadBanks & CAT Overlap.** Simulation frameworks for adaptive testing under calibration error, item reuse, and overlap constraints; evaluating rescoring, selection, and stopping rules.
- **Balancing Bias / APE (AI‑assisted scoring).** Ensemble LLM raters calibrated against human biases in MFRM; improving reliability and fairness.
- **GMM Diagnostics & IMV.** Identification checks, posterior instability diagnostics, and predictive comparisons between GMM and simpler growth models.
- **LEVANTE.** Cross‑cultural growth modeling and fairness evaluation across multilingual contexts (U.S., Canada, Colombia, Germany).
