I am a [Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University](https://profiles.stanford.edu/Doria_Xiao), working on the [**Learning Variability Network Exchange (LEVANTE)**](https://levante-network.org/) with Prof. **Ben Domingue** and collaborators. My research focuses on **psychometrics** and **Bayesian statistical modeling**, with interests in **measurement invariance** and the **integration of AI into educational and psychometric practice**.  

My dissertation, *Bayesian Identification, Estimation, and Evaluation of Growth Mixture Models*, advanced new methods for addressing **identifiability** and **model evaluation**, offering both theoretical diagnostics and practical guidance for applied researchers.  

Previously, I earned my [Ph.D. in Social Research Methodologies at UC Berkeley](https://bse.berkeley.edu/xingyao-xiao). I also hold an **M.S. in Applied Statistics and Psychometrics** from Boston College and a **B.A. in Statistics** from the University of Minnesota, Morris.
