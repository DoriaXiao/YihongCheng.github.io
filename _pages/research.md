### Current directions
- **Fairness and calibration in CAT.** Mitigating the impact of calibration error via *rescoring* and robust item selection/stopping rules.
- **AI‑assisted scoring and reliability.** Integrating LLM raters with human ratings using **MFRM** and ensemble strategies.
- **Growth mixture modeling.** Identification, estimation stability, and principled evaluation (marginal likelihood; diagnostics).

### Methods & tools
Bayesian and frequentist latent variable models; simulation frameworks for CAT & GMM; DIF and cross‑cultural invariance; process‑data modeling; R/Python/Stan; Quarto; GitHub‑first workflows.
